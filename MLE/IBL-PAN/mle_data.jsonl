The rules of the game can only be tentatively discern by identifying its components from text and document. In the article, I devote special attention to the analysis of variations in absentia, i.e. a situation in which, although only one version of the text is written, it can be compared with a version that is closer to the reader (or more expected). Variation in absentia is essential for analyzing both textual and material aspects of the writing process (e.g. page layout changes, pen changes, replacing writing aids). In this article, I follow this kind of variation from the sketches of Os Degraus do Parnaso (The Steps to Parnas), a collection of essays by the versatile writer and analytical philosopher M.S. Louren\u00e7o (1936\u20132009).

One of the most serious consequences of this process was literature studies\u2019 too easy renunciation of the separate status of its subject and scholarly apparatus, which occurred as a result of the cultural reorientation of the literary studies field. This led to the replacement of literary theory by a generalized cultural theory and the reduction of the literary text to the status of merely one of many equal subjects of cultural production practices. Against the background of modern literary theory, which now has become a purely historical phenomenon, poetics is revealed to be a discipline possessing not only vitality and expansiveness (a fact testified to by other fields\u2019 appropriation of concepts and categories developed by poetics), but also indispensable to the continued life of culturally-oriented literary studies.

Modernist literature, it is often understood, appropriates this conceptual paradigm while hinting at a possibility that space can also be perceived in terms of time and that temporalisation of space deconstructs the fa\u00e7ade of fixed and codified spatial meanings. Derrida defines this spatio-temporal (inter)reaction and logical co-signification as spacing (espacement). However, analysis of time and temporality, as well as analysis of space/place and spatiality, in modernist writing often falls into the pitfall of the problem of temporal succession and, subsequently, of the misconception that space is fixed. The problem of succession lies in the notion that time passes and ceases to be instant(ly), leaving only a Derridean \u201ctrace\u201d, which is spatial. This notion is problematic as it is based on the implications that space is firmly fixed and passive despite temporal \u201cspacing\u201d, or succession, and that space is passively imprinted upon with traces of time. I argue that space is far from fixed and passive. Its dynamism renders spatialisation of time problematic. I propose that Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Great Wall of China\u201d (written in 1917) is a fine example of a modernist writing which not only problematises the concepts of time and temporality as well as of space and spatiality, but also puts on centre stage the problem of spatialisation of time. With its physical and ideological gaps and fragments as well as traces of illusory and unfinished signification, the \u201cpiecemeal\u201d construction of the Great Wall of China in Kafka\u2019s short story not only exposes the process of spatialising time, but also reflects the modernist subtle re-evaluation of such a conceptual paradigm."}}

Its critical focus rests mainly on the first figure of the triad proposed in the title, and assesses the Stanford comparativist\u2019s strategy for carrying over methodologies from the empirical sciences to the study of literature. The essay\u2019s commentary provides an opportunity to interrogate contemporary links between the humanities and the hard sciences. These reflections ultimately prompt us to question this division and, following in Moretti\u2019s footsteps, help us unearth new approaches to literary studies that take their cue from the discursive practices of the hard sciences. This essay does not take as its point of reference the experimental approach that Moretti proposes, but instead an approach of creative experimentation - provoking an attitude of openness and the impulse to cultivate new, counter-intuitive methods for revisiting classical philological concepts."}}

Yet the renaissance of this literature unfolding today calls for new interpretations. To be more specific, this renaissance takes place in a climate of postmodern penchants for popular narrative and structural schemas, a blending of genre categories, and a predilection for heterogeneous discourses. This very fact should compel us to reflect on the factors contributing to the thriller\u2019s appeal as a genre form that writers so often evoke to provide the reader with a fictional and \u201cdeep\u201d statement on the various deficits of the contemporary world.&nbsp; In Czech literature, prose writers such as Roman Ludva and Milo\u0161 Urban have taken cues from Umberto Eco and Dan Brown\u2019s tendencies to experiment with well-worn narrative strategies, as well as their local tradition (the tales of the 19th-century neoromantic Jakub Arbes). Following suit, Ludva and Urban embed the templates of the thriller in a broadly organized interrogation of the contemporary condition of art. Simultaneously, using the strategy of \u201camplified\u201d intersemiosis, they impart an autothematic dimension to their narratives."}}
